//! The Five Lenses for stewardship evaluation.
//!
//! Each lens asks one stewardship question and evaluates independently.
//! Lenses cannot access other lenses' findings - synthesis is policy, not intelligence.
//!
//! ## Lens Independence
//!
//! - Lenses evaluate in parallel (simulated sequential in current implementation)
//! - No lens may access another lens's findings
//! - No shared mutable state between lenses
//! - Deterministic ordering guaranteed via BTreeMap
